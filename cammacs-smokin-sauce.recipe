2.5lb heirloom tomatoes (smoked)
1 onion (smoked)
2 jalepino (smoked)
14 garlic cloves (smoked)
1 cup of beer (ale)
1/2 cup brown sugar (you could also use maple syrup or white sugar)
1/2 cup cane white sugar
3/4 cup white vinegar
1/3 cup molasses
3 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 large lemon squeezed
2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons worchestshire sauce

Directions: Cut the tomatoes, onion, and jalepino in half. Add tomatoes, onion halves, jalepino and garlic cloves to smoker/grill set to 200-250F, smoke for 2 hours or until fully cooked. I use a weber kettle grill as a smoker so I will set the tomatoes and garlic on a pan to keep them from falling through my grill. Once done remove, let cool, and blend to a puree. Add to sauce pan and still in remaining ingredients. Simmer for 2-3 hours until desired consistency is achieved.
